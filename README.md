# Code Samples

- A nice example of the <a href=https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/tree/master/gwt/lib/place/src/main/java/com/avaritia/lib/place/client>adapter and visitor patterns</a> applied to Google Web Toolkit (GWT).  It obviates the standard chaining of instanceofs (see below) to which even googlers fall victim.

```java 
if ( o instanceof A ) {
   // cast to A and do stuff
} else if ( o instanceof B ) {
   // cast to B and do stuff
} else if ( o instanceof C ) {
...
}

```

- Old but clean <a href=https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/tree/master/gwt/ulyz/src/com/netmorpher>GWT client (MVC) and server (perl JSON)</a> code (pre RequestFactory days).

- State-of-the-art client <a href=https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/tree/master/gwt/app/in3s/src/main/java/com/avaritia/app/in3s/client>GWT client (MVP) code</a>.

- A tricky <a href=https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/blob/master/c%2B%2B/Base2DerivedWithoutRTTI.cpp>C++</a> problem that I solved for my dad.

- Server-side <a href=https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/tree/master/server>Java</a> code and tests.

- The basis for a framework of<a href="https://github.com/davepuchyr/samples/blob/master/c%2B%2B/lib-service">microservices</a> that are controlled by websockets and has a registry that uses shared memory.
